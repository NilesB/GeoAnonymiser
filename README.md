# GeoAnonymiser
Quick and dirty Chrome Extension that anonymises names and avatars for Geoguessr Battle Royale until the developers add a streamer mode.

## Installation
GeoAnonymiser is now available to install through the Chrome Web Store, [link here.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/geoanonymiser/homebajndhnifglamniohobpgddiejil)

If you want to install the extension from the source code the below instructions are skill relevant.
- Either clone the repo or download the repo as a ZIP (The code dropdown up and to the right) and extract the archive
- Go to More Tools -> Extensions on the Chrome options menu and check 'Developer Mode' at the top right
- Click 'Load unpacked' at the top left and select the folder that you just cloned/extracted
- Use GeoGuessr Battle Royale as usual

## How it works
The browser extension intercepts the user details network request and randomly generates a name for the user and removes the avatar.
