# GeoAnonymiser
Quick and dirty Chrome Extension that anonymises names and avatars for Geoguessr Battle Royale until the developers add a streamer mode.

## Installation
- Either clone the repo or download the repo as a ZIP (The code dropdown up and to the right) and extract the archive
- Go to More Tools -> Extensions on the Chrome options menu and check 'Developer Mode' at the top right
- Click 'Load unpacked' at the top left and select the folder that you just cloned/extracted
- Use GeoGuessr Battle Royale as usual

_I may package this for the Chrome store but I suspect the developers will add this feature before I get a chance_

## How it works
The browser extension intercepts the user details network request and randomly generates a name for the user and removes the avatar.
